# Gas Holder VR Visualization

**Author:** Tarun Kumar Arumugam  
**Platform:** Unity, Blender, Autodesk Maya  
**Project Type:** Industrial VR Visualization

---

## Overview

This project provides an interactive, real-time VR simulation of a gas holder facility. The 3D modeling and asset creation used both Autodesk Maya and Blender. The final assets were integrated into Unity for immersive VR visualization that can be experienced either in VR hardware or explored within the Unity Editor.
